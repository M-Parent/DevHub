**Tailscale** is a modern, zero-config VPN built on top of **WireGuard**. It lets your devices connect to each other privately as if they were all on the same LAN — anywhere in the world.

<Aside type="tip" title="Why Tailscale?">
  Unlike traditional VPNs, Tailscale requires no port forwarding, no public IP,
  and no complex configuration. It just works.
</Aside>

## Core Principles

Tailscale creates your own private network called a **Tailnet**:

| Feature                 | Benefit                                     |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| ✔ Private Tailnet       | Your own secure mesh network                |
| ✔ No port forwarding    | Works behind any NAT/firewall               |
| ✔ No public IP required | Perfect for home networks                   |
| ✔ Zero configuration    | Install and connect instantly               |
| ✔ Cross-platform        | Windows, Linux, macOS, iOS, Android, Docker |

## Ubuntu / Debian Installation

<Steps>

1. **Install Tailscale**

   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh
   ```

2. **Join your Tailnet**

   ```bash
   sudo tailscale up
   ```

3. **Authenticate**

   This will give you a login URL — open it in a browser, log in, and the server joins your network.

4. **Verify connection**

   You will now see all machines in your Tailnet with their IPs (100.x.x.x). Add a second device and try to ping!

</Steps>

<Terminal
  commands={[
    {
      input: "curl -fsSL https://tailscale.com/install.sh | sh",
      output: "Installation complete.",
    },
    {
      input: "sudo tailscale up",
      output:
        "To authenticate, visit:\n  https://login.tailscale.com/a/abc123xyz",
    },
    {
      input: "tailscale status",
      output:
        "100.100.100.1   myserver        linux   -\n100.100.100.2   mylaptop        macos   -",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Advanced Options

### Exit Node

An **exit node** routes all your internet traffic through a specific device in your Tailnet — like a personal VPN server.

```bash
sudo tailscale up --advertise-exit-node
```

<Aside type="note" title="Enable in Admin Console">
  After advertising, you must approve the exit node in the Tailscale admin
  console.
</Aside>

### Subnet Router

Advertise your local LAN so other Tailnet devices can access machines that don't have Tailscale installed:

```bash
sudo tailscale up --advertise-routes=192.168.1.0/24
```

Replace `192.168.1.0/24` with your actual home network subnet.

<Quiz
  question="What VPN protocol does Tailscale use under the hood?"
  options={["OpenVPN", "IPSec", "WireGuard", "PPTP"]}
  correct={2}
  explanation="Tailscale is built on WireGuard, a modern VPN protocol known for its speed, simplicity, and strong cryptography."
/>

<Quiz
  question="What IP range does Tailscale use for devices?"
  options={["192.168.x.x", "10.0.x.x", "172.16.x.x", "100.x.x.x"]}
  correct={3}
  explanation="Tailscale assigns IPs from the 100.x.x.x range (CGNAT range) to avoid conflicts with local networks."
