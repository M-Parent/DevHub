Build and deploy Scribbler-rs, an open-source multiplayer drawing and guessing game similar to Skribbl.io. This project teaches you how to build Go applications from source and deploy them as a service.

<Aside type="note" title="Project Overview">
  **Difficulty**: Mid **Time**: ~30 minutes **Skills**: Go, Git, Linux services

## What You'll Build

Scribbler-rs is a real-time multiplayer game where:

- One player draws a word
- Other players guess what's being drawn
- Points are awarded for correct guesses

## Step 1: Install Go

Go (Golang) is required to build the application.

<Steps>

1. **Download Go**

   ```bash
   wget https://go.dev/dl/go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   ```

   <Aside type="tip">
     Check [go.dev/dl](https://go.dev/dl/) for the latest version.
   </Aside>

2. **Extract to /usr/local**

   ```bash
   sudo tar -C /usr/local -xzf go1.22.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
   ```

3. **Add Go to PATH**

   Edit your profile:

   ```bash
   echo 'export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin' >> ~/.profile
   source ~/.profile
   ```

4. **Verify installation**

   ```bash
   go version
   ```

   Expected output:

   ```
   go version go1.22.0 linux/amd64
   ```

</Steps>

---

## Step 2: Install Git

If Git isn't already installed:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install git -y
```

Verify:

```bash
git --version
```

---

## Step 3: Clone the Repository

```bash
cd ~
git clone https://github.com/scribble-rs/scribble.rs.git
cd scribble.rs
```

---

## Step 4: Configure the Port

By default, Scribbler runs on port 8080. To run on port 80:

<Steps>

1. **Edit the config file**

   ```bash
   nano internal/config/config.go
   ```

2. **Find and change the port**

   Look for the port definition and change `8080` to `80`:

   ```go
   Port: 80,
   ```

3. **Save and exit** (Ctrl+X, Y, Enter)

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution" title="Port 80 Requires Root">
  Ports below 1024 require root privileges. You'll need to run with `sudo` or
  configure capabilities.
</Aside>

---

## Step 5: Build the Application

```bash
go build ./cmd/scribblers
```

This creates an executable named `scribblers` in the current directory.

---

## Step 6: Run the Game

### Quick Test

```bash
sudo ./scribblers
```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://your-server-ip`

### Stop with Ctrl+C

---

## Bonus: Create a Systemd Service

Make Scribbler run as a background service that starts on boot.

<Steps>

1. **Move the binary**

   ```bash
   sudo mv scribblers /usr/local/bin/
   ```

2. **Create service file**

   ```bash
   sudo tee /etc/systemd/system/scribbler.service << 'EOF'
   [Unit]
   Description=Scribbler Drawing Game
   After=network.target

   [Service]
   Type=simple
   User=root
   WorkingDirectory=/usr/local/bin
   ExecStart=/usr/local/bin/scribblers
   Restart=always
   RestartSec=5

   [Install]
   WantedBy=multi-user.target
   EOF
   ```

3. **Reload systemd**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   ```

4. **Start and enable the service**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start scribbler
   sudo systemctl enable scribbler
   ```

5. **Check status**

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status scribbler
   ```

</Steps>

### Service Commands

```bash
# Start the game
sudo systemctl start scribbler

# Stop the game
sudo systemctl stop scribbler

# Restart
sudo systemctl restart scribbler

# View logs
sudo journalctl -u scribbler -f
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem           | Solution                                       |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Port 80 in use    | Stop NGINX/Apache: `sudo systemctl stop nginx` |
| Permission denied | Use `sudo` or run on port 8080                 |
| Build fails       | Ensure Go is in PATH: `source ~/.profile`      |
| Can't connect     | Check firewall: `sudo ufw allow 80/tcp`        |
