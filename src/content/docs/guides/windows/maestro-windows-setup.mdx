Mobile automation testing used to be a headache. **Maestro** changes that. It is the simplest, most effective UI testing framework for Android and iOS, relying on simple YAML files instead of complex code.

While Maestro has native support for macOS, setting it up on Windows requires a few manual steps involving Java and the Android Debug Bridge (ADB).

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Before installing Maestro, we need two essential dependencies: Java and ADB.

### 1. Install Java (JDK 17+)

Maestro runs on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). We recommend the **Eclipse Temurin** distribution.

1. Go to [Adoptium.net](https://adoptium.net).
2. Click **Latest LTS Release** (Download JDK 17 or 21).
3. Run the installer.
4. <Aside type="danger" title="Crucial Step">
     When asked about custom setup, ensure you select **"Set JAVA_HOME
     variable"** (change the red X icon to "Will be installed on local hard
     drive").
   </Aside>
5. Finish the installation.

### 2. Install ADB (Android Debug Bridge)

This tool allows your PC to communicate with your Android device or emulator.

<Steps>
  1. Download the [SDK Platform-Tools for
  Windows](https://developer.android.com/tools/releases/platform-tools). 2.
  Extract the zip file to `C:\platform-tools`. 3. Open your **Command Prompt**
  (search "cmd" in the start menu). 4. Run the following command to add ADB to
  your system path: ```cmd setx PATH "%PATH%;C:\platform-tools" ```
</Steps>

<Terminal
  commands={[
    {
      input: "adb version",
      output: "Android Debug Bridge version 1.0.41\nVersion 34.0.4-10411341",
    },
  ]}
/>

## 🚀 Installing Maestro

Since Windows support is currently a manual process, we will perform a "Download & Path" setup.

### Step 1: Download & Extract

1. Download the latest Windows release: [maestro.zip](https://github.com/mobile-dev-inc/maestro/releases/latest/download/maestro.zip)
2. Extract the zip file to your user folder.
   - **Target Location:** `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\maestro`

<Aside type="note">
  Make sure the `bin` folder is inside. The path should look like:
  `C:\Users\YOUR_USERNAME\maestro\maestro\bin`
</Aside>

### Step 2: Update System Path

We need to tell Windows where to find the `maestro` command.

<FillBlank
  instruction="Complete the command to add Maestro to your User Path (using the %USERPROFILE% variable):"
  sentence="setx PATH [BLANK:%PATH%;%USERPROFILE%\maestro\maestro\bin]"
  hint="The path ends with \\maestro\\bin"
/>

### Step 3: Verification

Close your current Command Prompt and open a fresh one to reload the environment variables.

<Terminal commands={[{ input: "maestro --version", output: "1.39.0" }]} />

## 📱 Your First Test

Let's run a test on the Android **Settings** app.

1. **Connect Device:** Plug in your Android phone (with USB debugging enabled) or launch an Emulator.
2. **Verify Connection:** Run `adb devices` to ensure your device is listed.
3. **Create Flow:** Create a file named `flow.yaml` on your desktop and paste the following:

```yaml
appId: com.android.settings
---
- launchApp
- tapOn: "Battery"
- assertVisible: "Battery usage" # Verifies this text exists on screen
```

4. **Run the Test:**

```bash
cd Desktop
maestro test flow.yaml
```
