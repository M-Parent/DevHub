Losing access to an admin account on Windows 11 can be stressful, but there are several ways to get back in depending on how your account was set up (Microsoft Account vs. Local Account).

## Option 1: Microsoft Account Reset

If you sign in with an email (Outlook, Hotmail, etc.), your identity is managed in the cloud.

<Steps>

1. **Initiate Reset:** On the Windows login screen, click **I forgot my password**.

2. **Verify Identity:** Follow the on-screen prompts to receive a code via your recovery email or phone number.

3. **New Password:** Once reset, enter the new password on your PC.

</Steps>

<Aside type="caution" title="Internet Required">
  Your PC **must** be connected to the internet (Wi-Fi or Ethernet) for it to
  sync the new password from Microsoft's servers.
</Aside>

## Option 2: Local Account Security Questions

This only works if you configured security questions during the initial Windows setup or via Settings later.

1. Enter an incorrect password once to reveal the **Reset password** link.
2. Click the link and answer your pre-set security questions.
3. Enter a new password and log in.

## Option 3: The "Utilman" Hack (Advanced)

If you lack security questions and use a local account, you can use Windows Installation Media to "trick" Windows into opening a Command Prompt at the login screen.

<Aside type="danger" title="System Modification">
  This involves modifying system files (`utilman.exe`). Proceed with caution and
  ensure you have a backup of important data.
</Aside>

### Step-by-Step Hack

1. **Restart into Recovery:** On the login screen, hold the **Shift key** and click **Power > Restart**. Keep holding Shift until you see the Windows Recovery Environment.

2. **Open Command Prompt:** In the recovery window, navigate to **Troubleshoot > Advanced options > Command Prompt**.

3. **Replace Utility Manager:** Navigate to your Windows drive (usually `C:`) and run the following:

```bash
C: # to switch to the correct drive if needed
move c:\windows\system32\utilman.exe c:\windows\system32\utilman.exe.bak
copy c:\windows\system32\cmd.exe c:\windows\system32\utilman.exe
```

<Terminal
  commands={[
    {
      input:
        "move c:\\windows\\system32\\utilman.exe c:\\windows\\system32\\utilman.exe.bak",
      output: "1 file(s) moved.",
    },
    {
      input:
        "copy c:\\windows\\system32\\cmd.exe c:\\windows\\system32\\utilman.exe",
      output: "1 file(s) copied.",
    },
  ]}
/>

4. **Restart:** Remove any recovery media and restart your computer normally.

5. **Trigger CMD:** At the login screen, click the **Accessibility icon** (bottom right). A Command Prompt window will open with System privileges.

6. **Reset Password:** Run the following command:

```bash
net user [YourUsername] [NewPassword]
```

<Terminal
  commands={[
    {
      input: "net user [YourUsername] [NewPassword]",
      output: "The command completed successfully.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Option 4: Factory Reset (Last Resort)

If all else fails, you must reset the operating system.

1. Hold the **Shift key** and click **Power > Restart** on the login screen.
2. Navigate to **Troubleshoot > Reset this PC**.
3. Choose **Keep my files** (retains documents but removes apps) or **Remove everything**.
