If you've ever wanted to run applications reliably across different computers, Docker is a tool you need to know. At its core, Docker lets you package an app with all its dependencies into a lightweight container that can run anywhere—your laptop, a server, or the cloud.

Think of it like a portable, self-contained mini-computer for your app. No more "it works on my machine" problems!

## Core Docker Concepts

Docker has three fundamental elements:

<Flashcard
  title="Docker Core Components"
  cards={[
    {
      front: "Dockerfile",
      back: "A text file with instructions to build a Docker image - like DNA for your container",
    },
    {
      front: "Docker Image",
      back: "An immutable snapshot of your software with all dependencies - can be stored locally or on Docker Hub",
    },
    {
      front: "Docker Container",
      back: "A running instance of an image - isolated but lightweight, runs on any machine with Docker",
    },
  ]}
/>

---

### Dockerfile

Think of it as DNA for your container. It contains instructions to build a Docker image.

```dockerfile
FROM ubuntu:22.04                              # Base image
RUN apt-get update && apt-get install -y python3 python3-pip  # Install dependencies
ENV APP_ENV=production                         # Set environment variables
COPY . /app                                    # Copy your app files
WORKDIR /app                                   # Set working directory
CMD ["python3", "app.py"]                      # Default command when container starts
```

<Question
  question="What does the FROM instruction do in a Dockerfile?"
  answer="FROM specifies the base image to use as the starting point for your container. All subsequent instructions build on top of this base."
  hint="Think about the foundation of your container"
/>

---

### Docker Image

- Snapshot of your software with all dependencies
- Immutable: once built, it doesn't change
- Can be stored locally or uploaded to Docker Hub or other registries

---

### Docker Container

- The running instance of an image
- Can run on any machine that has Docker installed
- Containers are isolated, but lightweight

## Installation

To get hands-on with Docker, you'll need to install it on your machine first.

## Knowledge Check

<Quiz
  question="What is the difference between a Docker image and a container?"
  options={[
    "No difference, they are the same thing",
    "Image is the blueprint, container is the running instance",
    "Container is stored on disk, image runs in memory",
    "Image is for Linux, container is for Windows",
  ]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="A Docker image is an immutable template (blueprint) containing your app and dependencies. A container is a running instance of that image."
/>

<Quiz
  question="Which Dockerfile instruction sets the command to run when the container starts?"
  options={["RUN", "COPY", "CMD", "FROM"]}
  correct={2}
  explanation="CMD specifies the default command to execute when a container starts. RUN executes commands during the image build process."
/>

<Question
  question="Why would you use Docker instead of running apps directly on your machine?"
  answer="Docker ensures consistency across environments (dev, staging, production), isolates dependencies to avoid conflicts, and makes deployment portable and reproducible."
/>
