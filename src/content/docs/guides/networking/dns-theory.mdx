Every time you visit a website, your computer needs to know **where that site lives on the Internet**.  
Instead of remembering numbers like `172.217.160.142`, you type friendly names like `google.com`. DNS (Domain Name System) is the **phonebook of the Internet** — it converts domain names into IP addresses so devices can communicate.

<Aside type="tip" title="Think of it like...">
  DNS is like your smartphone contacts: you type "Mom," and your phone knows her
  number. DNS works the same way — you type `google.com`, and it finds the right
  IP address behind it.

### DNS Record Types

| Record  | Purpose                             |
| ------- | ----------------------------------- |
| `A`     | Domain → IPv4 address               |
| `AAAA`  | Domain → IPv6 address               |
| `CNAME` | Canonical name / alias              |
| `MX`    | Mail exchanger                      |
| `TXT`   | Arbitrary text (SPF, verification)  |
| `SOA`   | Start of Authority (zone metadata)  |
| `NS`    | Nameserver delegation               |
| `SRV`   | Service records (e.g., \_sip.\_tcp) |

## 🔄 How DNS Works — Step by Step

![DNS hierarchy diagram](../../../../assets/img/content/DNS-Schema.png)

When you type a domain in your browser, DNS translates it into an IP address:

### 1. Browser / Stub Resolver (Your device)

Your browser asks the OS resolver to find `example.com`.  
If the IP is in cache and TTL hasn't expired → return immediately.

### 2. Recursive Resolver (ISP or public DNS)

If not cached, the query goes to a **recursive resolver** (like `1.1.1.1` or `8.8.8.8`).  
This resolver can ask other servers and caches answers for future use.

### 3. Root Servers (.)

If the resolver doesn't know the answer, it asks a **root server**.  
Root servers don't have the domain IP; they point to the correct **TLD server** (e.g., `.com`).

### 4. TLD Servers (Top-Level Domain)

The resolver asks the TLD server which **authoritative server** handles `example.com`.

### 5. Authoritative Nameserver

The authoritative server responds with the actual IP address for the domain.

### 6. Return and Cache

The resolver returns the IP to your device.  
Both the resolver and your OS cache it to make future requests faster.

<Aside type="note" title="DNS Flow Summary">
  **Browser → Resolver → Root → TLD → Authoritative → Browser** DNS caches
  responses at multiple points to speed up repeat lookups.

## 🧠 Walkthrough Example

Let's resolve `www.wikipedia.org`:

1. Browser asks local resolver (e.g., `1.1.1.1`)
2. Resolver checks cache → **miss**
3. Resolver queries a root server → referral to `.org` TLD
4. Resolver queries `.org` TLD → referral to Wikimedia authoritative server
5. Resolver queries Wikimedia authoritative server → receives `208.80.154.224`
6. Resolver returns `208.80.154.224` to the browser; result cached for TTL seconds
