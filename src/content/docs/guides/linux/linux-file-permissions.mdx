File permissions control who can read, write, and execute files in Linux. Understanding permissions is essential for security and proper system administration.

---

## Viewing Permissions

Use `ls -l` to view file permissions:

```bash
ls -l
```

```
-rw-r--r--  1 devuser devgroup  4096 Nov  8 20:58 testfile
drwxr-xr-x  2 devuser devgroup  4096 Nov  8 19:21 testdir
lrwxrwxrwx  1 devuser devgroup    10 Nov  8 21:05 symlink -> ./testfile
```

### Permission Breakdown

| Character | Meaning            |
| --------- | ------------------ |
| `-`       | Regular file       |
| `d`       | Directory          |
| `l`       | Symbolic link      |
| `r`       | Read permission    |
| `w`       | Write permission   |
| `x`       | Execute permission |

The 10 characters break down as:

```
-rwxr-xr--
│└┬┘└┬┘└┬┘
│ │  │  └── Others: r-- (read only)
│ │  └───── Group:  r-x (read + execute)
│ └──────── User:   rwx (read + write + execute)
└────────── Type:   - (regular file)
```

## Octal (Numeric) Notation

Permissions can be represented as numbers:

| Permission  | Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Read (r)    | 4     |
| Write (w)   | 2     |
| Execute (x) | 1     |

Add them together for combined permissions:

| Octal | Permissions | Meaning                |
| ----- | ----------- | ---------------------- |
| 7     | rwx         | Read + Write + Execute |
| 6     | rw-         | Read + Write           |
| 5     | r-x         | Read + Execute         |
| 4     | r--         | Read only              |
| 3     | -wx         | Write + Execute        |
| 2     | -w-         | Write only             |
| 1     | --x         | Execute only           |
| 0     | ---         | No permissions         |

### Common Permission Sets

| Octal | Symbolic  | Use Case                      |
| ----- | --------- | ----------------------------- |
| 755   | rwxr-xr-x | Executable files, directories |
| 644   | rw-r--r-- | Regular files                 |
| 600   | rw------- | Private files (SSH keys)      |
| 700   | rwx------ | Private directories           |
| 777   | rwxrwxrwx | Full access (avoid!)          |

## Changing Permissions with chmod

### Octal Method

```bash
chmod 755 script.sh
chmod 644 document.txt
chmod 600 ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
```

### Symbolic Method

```bash
chmod u+x script.sh      # Add execute for user
chmod g-w file.txt       # Remove write for group
chmod o=r file.txt       # Set others to read only
chmod a+r file.txt       # Add read for all
```

| Symbol | Meaning              |
| ------ | -------------------- |
| u      | User (owner)         |
| g      | Group                |
| o      | Others               |
| a      | All (u+g+o)          |
| +      | Add permission       |
| -      | Remove permission    |
| =      | Set exact permission |

### Examples

These are equivalent:

```bash
chmod 777 testfile
chmod u=rwx,g=rwx,o=rwx testfile
chmod a=rwx testfile
```

## Changing Ownership with chown

The `chown` command changes file ownership.

```bash
chown user:group file
```

### Change User Owner

```bash
sudo chown devuser testfile
```

### Change Group Owner

```bash
sudo chown :devgroup testfile
```

### Change Both

```bash
sudo chown devuser:devgroup testfile
```

### Recursive Change

```bash
sudo chown -R devuser:devgroup /path/to/directory
```

## Directory Permissions

For directories, permissions have slightly different meanings:

| Permission  | File            | Directory            |
| ----------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| Read (r)    | View contents   | List files           |
| Write (w)   | Modify contents | Create/delete files  |
| Execute (x) | Run as program  | Enter directory (cd) |

<Aside type="note">
  To access files in a directory, you need **execute** permission on the
  directory, even if you have read permission on the files inside.
</Aside>

<Question
  question="What's the difference between chmod and chown?"
  answer="chmod changes the permissions (read/write/execute) of a file. chown changes the ownership (user and group) of a file."
