<Badge text="Kubernetes" class="kubernetes" />

Kubernetes (K8s) is a container orchestration platform that makes many servers act like one. Released by Google in 2015, it's now maintained by a large community and is the industry standard for container management.

## What is Kubernetes?

Kubernetes is a **container orchestrator** that:

- Runs on top of Docker (usually) as a set of APIs in containers
- Provides API/CLI to manage containers across servers
- Automates deployment, scaling, and management of containerized applications

### Who Uses It?

- Many cloud providers offer managed Kubernetes (GKE, EKS, AKS)
- Many vendors make "distributions" of Kubernetes
- Used by organizations of all sizes

## Why Kubernetes?

### When You Need Orchestration

Orchestration becomes valuable when:

- You have many servers
- Your change rate is high
- Manual management becomes unsustainable

**Formula:**

```
Servers + Change Rate = Benefit of Orchestration
```

<Aside type="note" title="Not Always Needed">
  Not every solution needs orchestration. For simple applications on a few
  servers, Docker Compose or Docker Swarm may be sufficient.
</Aside>

### The Decision Path

1. First, understand **why** you may need orchestration
2. Then, decide **which** orchestrator (K8s vs Swarm)
3. If Kubernetes, decide **which distribution**:
   - Cloud managed (GKE, EKS, AKS)
   - Self-managed (Rancher, OpenShift, Docker Enterprise)

## Kubernetes vs Docker Swarm

| Aspect             | Kubernetes    | Swarm      |
| ------------------ | ------------- | ---------- |
| **Ease of Use**    | Complex       | Simpler    |
| **Features**       | More features | 80/20 rule |
| **Learning Curve** | Steeper       | Gentler    |
| **Community**      | Larger        | Smaller    |
| **Vendor Support** | Extensive     | Limited    |

### Advantages of Swarm

- ✅ Comes built into Docker
- ✅ Easiest to deploy/manage yourself
- ✅ Follows 80/20 rule (20% of features for 80% of use cases)
- ✅ Runs anywhere Docker runs
- ✅ Secure by default
- ✅ Easier to troubleshoot

### Advantages of Kubernetes

- ✅ Clouds will deploy/manage it for you
- ✅ Wide vendor support and distributions
- ✅ Largest adoption and community
- ✅ Most flexible, covers widest set of use cases
- ✅ "Kubernetes first" vendor support
- ✅ Industry standard (the safe choice)

<Aside type="tip" title="Choosing Between Them">
  Understand both and know your requirements. Swarm for simplicity, Kubernetes
  for enterprise features and vendor support.
</Aside>

## Core Components

### System Parts

| Component         | Description                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Kubernetes**    | The whole orchestration system (K8s or "Kube")         |
| **kubectl**       | CLI to configure K8s and manage apps ("kube-control")  |
| **Node**          | A server (VM or physical) in the cluster               |
| **Kubelet**       | Kubernetes agent running on each node                  |
| **Control Plane** | Containers that manage the cluster (formerly "master") |

### Control Plane Components

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              Control Plane                   │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────┤

## Key Abstractions

| Abstraction    | Description                                         |
| -------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Pod**        | One or more containers running together on one node |
| **Controller** | Creates/updates pods (Deployment, ReplicaSet, etc.) |
| **Service**    | Network endpoint to connect to pods                 |
| **Namespace**  | Logical grouping of objects in a cluster            |

### Pods

- Basic unit of deployment
- Containers are **always** in pods
- Usually one container per pod
- Pods share network and storage

### Controllers

Common controller types:

- **Deployment** - Manages ReplicaSets and pods
- **ReplicaSet** - Ensures desired number of pod replicas
- **DaemonSet** - One pod per node
- **StatefulSet** - For stateful applications
- **Job/CronJob** - For batch workloads

<Flashcard
  title="Pods and Controllers"
  cards={[
    {
      front: "What's the relationship between Pods and Controllers?",
      back: "Controllers manage pods. A Deployment creates a ReplicaSet, which creates Pods. The controller watches the desired state and makes changes to match it.",
    },
  ]}
/>

---

## Basic Workflow

When you deploy an application:

```
1. You create a Deployment (kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml)
        ↓
2. API Server receives the request
        ↓
3. Controller Manager creates a ReplicaSet
        ↓
4. Scheduler assigns pods to nodes
        ↓
5. Kubelet on each node starts containers
        ↓
6. Your app is running!
```

## When to Use Kubernetes

### Good Fit

- ✅ Many microservices
- ✅ Multiple teams deploying independently
- ✅ Need for auto-scaling
- ✅ Complex networking requirements
- ✅ Cloud-native applications

### Not a Good Fit

- ❌ Single application on few servers
- ❌ Team unfamiliar with containers
- ❌ Simple deployment requirements
- ❌ Limited operations resources
