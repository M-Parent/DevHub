Ansible is an open-source automation tool that simplifies configuration management, application deployment, and task automation. Unlike other tools, Ansible is agentless - it connects to your nodes via SSH and pushes configurations.

<Aside type="tip" title="Why Ansible?">
  Ansible uses simple YAML syntax (playbooks) that's easy to read and write. No
  agents to install on managed nodes, just SSH access.
</Aside>

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have:

- Ubuntu Linux (20.04 or later)
- `sudo` privileges
- SSH access to target servers
- Git installed

## Installing Ansible with pipx

The recommended way to install Ansible is with `pip` or `pipx`. Using `pipx` keeps Ansible in an isolated environment, avoiding conflicts with system packages.

<Steps>

1. **Install pipx**

   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install pipx
   pipx ensurepath
   ```

2. **Install Ansible**

   ```bash
   pipx install --include-deps ansible
   ```

3. **Log out and back in**

   This updates your shell's PATH to include the pipx binaries.

4. **Verify installation**

   ```bash
   ansible --version
   ```

   You should see output showing the Ansible version and Python interpreter.

</Steps>

<Aside type="note" title="Alternative Installation">
  You can also install via apt: `sudo apt install ansible`, but this may give
  you an older version.
</Aside>

## Setting Up Your Ansible Project

### Create a Git Repository

It's best practice to version control your Ansible configurations. This ensures you can track changes, collaborate, and recover from mistakes.

<Steps>

1. **Create a project directory**

   ```bash
   mkdir ansible-project
   cd ansible-project
   ```

2. **Initialize Git**

   ```bash
   git init
   ```

3. **Create a .gitignore file**

   ```bash
   cat > .gitignore << 'EOF'
   # Ansible
   *.retry
   .vault_password
   *.log

   # Python
   __pycache__/
   *.pyc
   .venv/

   # Sensitive files
   *.pem
   *.key
   credentials.yml
   EOF
   ```

4. **Create basic folder structure**

   ```bash
   mkdir -p inventory roles group_vars host_vars files templates
   ```

5. **Connect to remote repository**

   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial Ansible project setup"
   git remote add origin <your-repository-url>
   git push -u origin main
   ```

</Steps>

## Project Structure

A well-organized Ansible project follows this structure:

```
ansible-project/
├── ansible.cfg           # Ansible configuration
├── inventory/
│   └── hosts.yml         # Inventory file
├── group_vars/
│   └── all.yml           # Variables for all hosts
├── host_vars/            # Per-host variables
├── roles/                # Reusable roles
├── files/                # Static files to copy
├── templates/            # Jinja2 templates
└── playbooks/            # Your playbooks
```

### Create ansible.cfg

Create a project-level configuration file:

```ini
[defaults]
inventory = inventory
host_key_checking = False
retry_files_enabled = False

[privilege_escalation]
become = True
become_method = sudo
```

<Aside type="caution" title="Security Note">
  Setting `host_key_checking = False` is convenient for labs but not recommended
  for production. In production, verify host keys properly.
