An **ARR Stack** is a **collection of automated applications** that work together to manage, download, and organize your media content.

## Why is it Called ARR?

Each letter represents a key type of tool in the ecosystem:

| Letter | Meaning               | Examples                  |
| ------ | --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| **A**  | Automation / Apps     | Sonarr, Radarr, Bazarr    |
| **R**  | Requests              | Prowlarr, Overseerr       |
| **R**  | Retrieval / Downloads | qBittorrent, Transmission |

<Aside type="tip" title="In Short">
  An ARR Stack is a **coordinated ecosystem of automated services** that manage
  your media from discovery to playback.

## Docker and the ARR Stack

Most ARR services run inside **Docker containers** because it makes installation and management super easy.

With Docker, each service runs in its own isolated environment, so you don't have to worry about messy dependencies, system conflicts, or complex setups.

  Fundamentals](/guides/docker-fundamentals/) guide.

## Common ARR Tools

## How the ARR Stack Works Together

```
Prowlarr (Indexers) ──▶ Sonarr (TV Shows) ─┐
                                           │
                                           ├──▶ Gluetun (VPN) ─▶ qBittorrent ─▶ Plex/Jellyfin
                                           │
                                           └──▶ Bazarr (Subtitles)
Prowlarr (Indexers) ──▶ Radarr (Movies) ───┘
```

### Workflow

1. **Prowlarr** - Searches indexers for available TV shows or movies
2. **Sonarr / Radarr** - Receive info and decide which content to download
3. **Gluetun** - Routes all download traffic through a secure VPN
4. **qBittorrent** - Handles the actual downloading
5. **Bazarr** - Monitors downloads to automatically fetch subtitles
6. **Plex / Jellyfin** - Makes your media available for streaming
