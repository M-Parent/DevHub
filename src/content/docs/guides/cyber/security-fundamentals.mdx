Information security is the practice of protecting information by mitigating risks. This guide covers the fundamental concepts every IT professional should understand.

## The CIA Triad

The three pillars of information security:

| Principle           | Description                                                              |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Confidentiality** | Information should only be read by authorized persons                    |
| **Integrity**       | Data is stored and transferred as intended, modifications are authorized |
| **Availability**    | Information is accessible to those authorized to view or modify it       |

### Non-Repudiation

A fourth principle often added:

- **Non-Repudiation** - Persons cannot deny having created or modified data

<Flashcard
  title="CIA Triad"
  cards={[
    {
      front: "What are the three pillars of the CIA Triad?",
      back: "Confidentiality (only authorized access), Integrity (data is unaltered), and Availability (accessible when needed). Non-repudiation is often added as a fourth principle.",
    },
  ]}
/>

## Security Frameworks

### Why Use Frameworks?

- Provide a **legal framework** for compliance
- Ensure **standardization** across the organization
- Enable consistent security practices
- Help with audits and assessments

### Common Frameworks

| Framework    | Focus                             |
| ------------ | --------------------------------- |
| NIST         | Comprehensive security guidelines |
| ISO 27001    | Information security management   |
| CIS Controls | Prioritized security actions      |
| COBIT        | IT governance and management      |

## Access Control

Access control determines who can access what resources.

### Key Concept: Identification

Users must prove their identity before accessing resources.

### The AAA Model

| Component          | Description                            |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------- |
| **Authentication** | Verify identity (password, biometrics) |
| **Authorization**  | Determine permissions                  |
| **Accounting**     | Track actions and access               |

---

## Security Control Categories

| Category        | Description                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **Managerial**  | Policies and procedures that oversee the system    |
| **Operational** | Depends on people for implementation               |
| **Technical**   | Implemented in OS, software, and security devices  |
| **Physical**    | Devices regulating access to premises and hardware |

---

## Functional Security Controls

| Type             | Purpose                            | Example                      |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **Preventive**   | Stop incidents before they occur   | Firewalls, encryption        |
| **Detective**    | Identify incidents when they occur | IDS, log monitoring          |
| **Corrective**   | Fix issues after they occur        | Patches, backups             |
| **Directive**    | Guide behavior                     | Policies, training           |
| **Deterrent**    | Discourage attackers               | Warning signs, legal notices |
| **Compensating** | Alternative when primary fails     | Manual review                |

## Roles and Responsibilities

### Organizational Levels

| Level           | Focus                                      |
| --------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| **Strategic**   | Long-term vision, policies, risk appetite  |
| **Tactical**    | Medium-term planning, projects, procedures |
| **Operational** | Day-to-day security operations             |

### Key Roles

| Role                       | Responsibility                         |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Overall Responsibility** | Executive accountability               |
| **Manager**                | Team oversight and resource allocation |
| **Technical**              | Implementation and maintenance         |
| **Non-Technical**          | Policy compliance and awareness        |

### Due Care & Liability

Organizations must demonstrate **due care** - reasonable steps to protect information. Failure can result in liability.

<Aside type="caution" title="Insider Threat">
  Insider threats are often more dangerous than external attacks because
  insiders already have access and knowledge of systems.

## Attack Vectors

### Software Vectors

- Vulnerable software with unpatched flaws
- Unsupported systems and applications
- Client-based vs agentless vulnerabilities

### Network Vectors

- Remote vs local exploitation techniques
- Unsecured networks
- Man-in-the-middle attacks

### Lure-Based Vectors

Baits designed to tempt targets:

- Removable devices (USB)
- Executable files
- Document files (macros)
- Image files (steganography)

### Message-Based Vectors

| Vector            | Examples                      |
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Email             | Phishing, malware attachments |

| Instant Messaging | Malicious links               |
| Social Media      | Fake profiles, scams          |
| Voice Calls       | Vishing                       |

    {
      front: "What's the difference between phishing and vishing?",
      back: "Phishing uses email or messages to trick users into revealing information. Vishing (voice phishing) uses phone calls to manipulate victims into giving up sensitive data.",
