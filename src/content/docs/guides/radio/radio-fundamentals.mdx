## The Electromagnetic Spectrum

The electromagnetic spectrum is the complete range of electromagnetic radiation, organized by frequency or wavelength.

### Spectrum Bands

| Band             | Symbol | Characteristics          |
| ---------------- | ------ | ------------------------ |
| 📡 Radio waves   | RF     | 1m to 100km wavelength   |
| 🍕 Microwaves    | MW     | 1mm to 1m wavelength     |
| 🔥 Infrared      | IR     | Heat radiation           |
| 👁️ Visible light | VIS    | Human-visible spectrum   |
| ☀️ Ultraviolet   | UV     | Higher energy light      |
| 🦴 X-rays        | X      | Medical imaging          |
| ☢️ Gamma rays    | γ      | Highest energy radiation |

<Aside type="note">
  Electromagnetic waves in each band have different characteristics — how they
  are produced, how they interact with matter, and their practical applications.
</Aside>

<Question
  question="What determines where a wave falls on the electromagnetic spectrum?"
  answer="Its frequency or wavelength. Lower frequencies have longer wavelengths, higher frequencies have shorter wavelengths."

## Radio Frequency Bands

We use three primary types of radio frequencies: **HF**, **VHF**, and **UHF**.

### HF (High Frequency)

| Property    | Value                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Wavelength  | 100m to 10m                 |
| Frequency   | 3MHz to 30MHz               |
| Propagation | Ionospheric skip (BLOS)     |
| Use Case    | Long-distance communication |

<Aside type="tip">
  HF waves travel long distances by bouncing off the ionosphere, creating skip
  zones.
</Aside>

### VHF (Very High Frequency)

| Property    | Value                       |
| ----------- | --------------------------- |
| Wavelength  | 10m to 1m                   |
| Frequency   | 30MHz to 300MHz             |
| Propagation | Line of Sight (LOS)         |
| Use Case    | Medium-distance, open areas |

---

### UHF (Ultra High Frequency)

| Property    | Value                                 |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Wavelength  | 1m to 30cm                            |
| Frequency   | 300MHz to 3000MHz                     |
| Propagation | Line of Sight (LOS)                   |
| Use Case    | Short-distance, urban/complex terrain |

<Aside type="note">
  UHF has excellent penetration capabilities, making it ideal for urban
  environments.

## Line of Sight Concepts

### LOS (Line of Sight)

Both antennas need to "see" each other to transmit effectively. The limit is the Earth's curvature — the **radio horizon**.

### BLOS (Beyond Line of Sight)

Transmitter and receiver do not need direct visibility, allowing greater distance and coverage.

<Aside type="note">
  SATCOM is considered BLOS, but the dish and satellite communicate via LOS.
</Aside>

<Question
  question="Why can HF communicate beyond line of sight?"
  answer="HF waves bounce off the ionosphere, allowing them to travel beyond the radio horizon and reach distant receivers."
/>

    { left: "UHF", right: "Urban/complex terrain" },
    { left: "SATCOM", right: "Global coverage via satellite" },
  ]}
/>

### Why HF Over SATCOM?

We prefer HF for BLOS communication because it operates **independently** — no reliance on external infrastructure like satellites.

| Band    | Advantages                                        | Disadvantages                             |
| ------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| **HF**  | Independent, long-range BLOS                      | Skip zones, low bandwidth, large antennas |
| **VHF** | Balanced range/performance                        | Less effective in complex terrain         |
| **UHF** | Great penetration, small antennas, high bandwidth | Short range, weather-sensitive            |

## Modulation Types

### AM (Amplitude Modulation)

Varies the **amplitude** (voltage strength) of the carrier wave.

- Greater transmission distance
- More susceptible to noise
- Used in aircraft communication ✈️

### FM (Frequency Modulation)

Varies the **frequency** of the carrier wave.

- Better voice quality
- More resistant to interference
- Signal drops rapidly when fading
- Common in VHF/UHF radios

<Quiz
  question="Which modulation type provides better voice quality but drops rapidly when fading?"
  options={["AM", "FM", "QAM", "P25"]}
  correct={1}
  explanation="FM provides better voice quality and interference resistance, but the signal drops rapidly once it begins to fade, unlike AM which degrades gradually."

## NVIS (Near Vertical Incidence Skywave)

![NVIS Propagation Diagram](../../../../assets/img/content/radio-fondamental.png)

NVIS aims the signal almost straight up, causing it to bounce back down closer to the transmitter.

### NVIS Advantages

- Reduces or eliminates skip zones
- Harder to detect and locate transmitter
- Reliable regional coverage (0-400 km radius)
- Works in mountainous terrain where LOS is blocked

<Aside type="tip">
  Use NVIS for short to medium-range HF when you need BLOS coverage without
  large skip zones.
</Aside>
